//! and everything the callback applies goes through `smooth`, because a gain
//! that jumps between buffers is a click whatever it is a gain of.
//!
//! The bands are a Linkwitz-Riley four-pole split, which is what sums back to
//! flat: a two-pole split leaves a 3 dB hump at the crossover, and a DJ EQ
//! with every band at centre has to be the track. The low band is run through
//! the second crossover as well and its two halves summed, which is that
//! crossover's all-pass — without it the low band arrives phase-rotated
//! against the other two and the sum dips where they meet.
