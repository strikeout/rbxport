//! The browser's preview player: a click on a row's waveform plays the track
//! from there without loading it onto a deck.
//!
//! What rekordbox does, from its own binary (rekordbox 7, macOS arm64):
//!
//! - [OBS] `browse::ListViewer::cellClickedWithLeftButton` sends a plain left
//!   click on the Preview column (column id 68) to
//!   `PreviewComponent::clickWave`, unless the click is the second of a double
//!   click, is being dragged, or carries Shift or Command.
//! - [OBS] `clickWave` takes the click's x across the waveform, clamped to it,
//!   as a fraction of the track's length, and calls
//!   `ListViewer::startPreviewPlayer` with that time.
//! - [OBS] `ListViewer::preparePreviewPlayer` refuses a track whose file is
//!   not there (`db::isValidMediaPath`), stops a preview of another track,
//!   and loads the track into `PreviewPlayer` — its own player, not a deck.
//!   A click on the track already previewing only moves it.
//! - [OBS] `ListViewer::startPreviewPlayer` pauses any deck that is playing
//!   unless the app is in PERFORMANCE mode, then starts the preview.
//!   rbxport's player is EXPORT mode's, so the decks are paused here.
//! - [OBS] `PreviewComponent::cueRegionMouseDown` starts the preview from a
//!   hot cue's own time when its badge is clicked.
//!
//! [ASSUME] rekordbox can route its preview to a separate output channel
//! (`OutputChannel_Preview`). rbxport has one output, so the preview plays on
//! the same device the decks use.
//!
//! The preview is a second engine of its own, playing on its deck A. It shares
//! nothing with the decks but the device it opens.
